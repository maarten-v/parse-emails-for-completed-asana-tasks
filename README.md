So your emailbox is getting pretty full, you can't keep up anymore with all the tasks you have to do, and was that old email for this Asana task for a task that's already completed?
It takes a lot of time to check for every Asana email if the task is already completed or not.
This app reads your emailbox for all Asana emails, checks if the task is already completed in Asana, and if so, moves the email to a seperate emailbox.
